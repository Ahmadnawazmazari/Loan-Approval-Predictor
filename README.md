#Author: Ahmad Nawaz
#This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the 'loan.csv' dataset, exploring various statistical aspects using Python. The analysis focuses on different dimensions of loan data, offering insights into their amount, interest whether he will pay or not. and more.

##Tools and Libraries Used Python: A versatile programming language, ideal for data manipulation and analysis. Scikit Learn: used in Machine Learning Very handy tool. Pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, used for data cleaning, transformation, and statistical analysis. Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. NumPy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. 

**##Preprocessing of Data:**
Data Preparation: The dataset was cleaned by removing missing values and duplicates, ensuring the integrity of subsequent analyses.

Variable Identification: We identified variable types within the dataset, distinguishing between numerical and categorical data, and encoded was performed.

**##Visulization of Data
** Bar Graph: Illustrated the frequency of purpose of loans.
Pie Chart: Showcased the distribution of types of loan as a percentage of the total.
Central Tendency Analysis: Computed the average interest rate, providing an insight into the general interest trend in the dataset.

Variance and Standard Deviation: These statistical measures were calculated for key numerical columns, offering insights into data spread and variability.

Interquartile Range (IQR) and Outliers: Identified the IQR for numerical columns to detect outliers, aiding in understanding the distribution characteristics of the data.

Histograms and Skewness: Generated histograms for all numerical columns and calculated skewness to understand the distribution shapes and asymmetry in the data.


**##Outcomes and Insights**
The analysis revealed the distribution of loans and the prevalence of different variables in the dataset.
We calculated the average interest rate, providing valuable insights into the market's pricing structure.
The variance and standard deviation calculations highlighted the variability and dispersion in interest rate, purpose, and other numerical factors.
By analyzing IQR and outliers, we gained insights into the typical range of values and identified exceptional cases in the dataset.
Histograms and skewness calculations allowed us to visualize and quantify the distribution of numerical data, revealing trends and patterns not immediately apparent.
This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to basic statistical analysis and visualization in Python, leveraging popular libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
